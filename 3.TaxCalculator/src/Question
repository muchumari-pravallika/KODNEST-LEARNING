Question 1: Tax Calculator

**Scenario**: Sophia is building a tax calculator for a retail store. She needs a program that calculates the total cost including tax for a given purchase amount and tax rate.

**Hint**: Sophia can create a method named `calculateTotalWithTax` that takes two doubles (purchase amount and tax rate) as inputs and returns the calculated total cost. Inside the method, she should calculate the tax amount using the formula `purchase amount * tax rate`, then add it to the purchase amount.

Sample Output:

Enter the purchase amount: 100

Enter the tax rate (in decimal form): 0.08

Total cost including tax: 108.0

Question 29: Logical Operator Validator

**Scenario**: Ethan is developing a user registration system. He needs a program that validates user input based on multiple conditions using logical operators.

**Hint**: Ethan can create a method named `isValidInput` that takes two booleans (one indicating if the input is valid and the other indicating if the input meets a certain condition) as inputs and returns a boolean value. Inside the method, he can use logical operators (AND, OR) to combine the conditions and determine if the input is valid.

Sample Output:

Is input valid (true/false): true

Does input meet a certain condition (true/false): true

Input is valid.
